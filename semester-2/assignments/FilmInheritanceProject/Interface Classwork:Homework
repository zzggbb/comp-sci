Interface Classwork/Homework
10 points

Use the ideas we have discussed regarding Java interfaces, abstract classes and
derived classes to design one interface and four classes that work together
like the Shape classes posted online.  The classes may model any behavior you
would like, but the important ideas of each type of class/interface must be
illustrated correctly.

Details

the interface:
    this should be a set of methods that describe the behavior you want any
    class that implements your interface to have.  It is appropriate for
    any constants used in implementing classes to be declared and
    initialized here.

the abstract class:
    this class should contain instance variables and implemented methods that
    are common to any derived class but will not be abstract if all of the
    methods required from the interface are implemented.

two derived classes:
    these classes should be fully implemented, maximizing use of the
    already-written code from the parent class.  Make two different logical
    subclasses from the abstract class described above.

the driver:
    use your classes as appropriate and “show off” as many features as you can.
