#Polymorphism

 * concrete classes are classes in which all methods are defined.

  * only concrete classes can be instantiated

 * abstract classes are non-concrete and cannot be instantiated

  * they can be used as the type, eg:

    abstract class Animal {}
    ...
    Animal x = new Dog();
