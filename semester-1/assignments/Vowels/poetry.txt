The Dentist Pulled My Tooth Out
by Kenn Nesbitt


The dentist pulled my tooth out,
and he thought it was such fun,
he grabbed his pliers
and dental priers
and pulled another one.

"Yippee! Hooray! What awesome fun!"
he shouted out with glee.
He grinned a grin
then went back in
and pulled out number three.

Then number four and number five
and numbers six and seven
were followed by
a cheerful cry
of "Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven!"

He took a few more from the top
and some from underneath;
he yanked them fast
until at last
he'd pulled out all my teeth.

Without my teeth I cannot chew;
I just eat soup and mush.
But don't be sad.
I'm kind of glad--
I'll never have to brush!
